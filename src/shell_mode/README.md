# Shell Mode

Shell mode helps OrchidOS' classic desktop work like a Linux desktop shell and gives it compatibility with Linux GUI apps to allow you to launch your existing Linux apps alongside Orchid apps.

It's disabled by default due to most users already having what they need in the form of Orchid apps and also because Linux apps have a significantly inferior ecosystem, sandboxing, security and user experience and a overwhelming fragmentation of packages that will scare people away. So we just made it so you only have Orchid apps by default which are simple regular apps that do what they need to do.

It's like ChromeOS Crostini but Linux apps are directly running in OrchidOS.
